## Question 32 ##

(Click [here](q32-image.png) to view the question in its original image format in Portuguese)

There is a large number of implementations for sorting algorithms. One of the factors to be considered, for example, is the maximum and average number of comparisons that are necessary to sort a vector with n elements. It is also said that a sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the order of elements that are equal. That is, if such elements appear in the sorted sequence in the same order as they are in the initial sequence. Analyze the algorithm below, where A is a vector and "i, j, lo and hi" are indices of the vector:

```
algorithm sort(A, lo, hi)
    if lo < hi then
        p := partition(A, lo, hi)
        sort(A, lo, p - 1)
        sort(A, p + 1, hi)

algorithm partition(A, lo, hi)
    pivot := A\[hi\]
    i := lo
    repeat for j := lo to hi
        if A\[j\] < pivot then
            swap A\[i\] with A\[j\]
            i := i + 1
    swap A\[i\] with A\[hi\]
    return i
```

In relation to the presented algorithm, evaluate the following statements.

I. The algorithm requires additional *O(n)* space for the recursion stack.

II. The presented algorithm is a recursive and stable sorting algorithm.

III. The algorithm needs, on average, *O(n log n)* comparisons to sort *n* items.

IV. The use of the first element of the vector as the "pivot" is more efficient than using the last one.

It is correct only what is stated in

A) I and III.

B) II and IV.

C) III and IV.

D) I, II and III.

E) I, II and IV.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

The algorithm presented is an implementation of the Quicksort sorting algorithm. Let's analyze the statements based on the structure and functioning of this algorithm:

I. The algorithm requires additional O(n) space for the recursion stack.

**Correct**. In the worst case, Quicksort can require a recursion stack of size O(n), especially when the array is nearly sorted or nearly reverse sorted, and the chosen pivot is consistently the smallest or the largest element.

II. The presented algorithm is a recursive and stable sorting algorithm.

**Partially correct**. The algorithm is indeed recursive. However, it is not stable. Stability in sorting algorithms refers to maintaining the original order of records with equal values. In Quicksort, because of the partitioning method used, it is possible that two equal values may swap places with each other.

III. On average, the algorithm requires O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items.

**Correct**. On average, Quicksort has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, it is important to note that in the worst-case scenario, its complexity can increase to O(n^2), but with good pivot selection strategies (such as median of three), this behavior can be mitigated.

IV. Using the first element of the array as the "pivot" is more efficient than using the last.

**Incorrect**. The efficiency of pivot choice in Quicksort depends on the data distribution in the array. Always using either the first or the last element as the pivot can lead to poor performance (O(n^2)) if the array is almost sorted or almost reverse sorted. A common strategy to improve this is to use the "median of three" as the pivot.

Based on the analyses, the correct statements are I and III.

The correct answer is **A) I and III**.
