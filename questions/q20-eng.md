**English transcription of the question:**

Observe the code below written in the C language.

```
1  #include <stdio.h>
2  #define SIZE 10
3  int function1(int vector\[\], int v){
4      int i;
5      for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++){
6          if (vector\[i\] == v)
7              return i;
8      }
9      return -1;
10 }
11 int function2(int vector\[\], int v, int i, int f){
12     int m = (i + f) / 2;
13     if (v == vector\[m\])
14         return m;
15     if (i >= f)
16         return -1;
17     if (v > vector\[m\])
18         return function2(vector, v, m+1, f);
19     else
20         return function2(vector, v, i, m-1);
21 }
22 int main(){
23     int vector\[SIZE\] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19};
24     printf("%d & %d", function1(vector, 15), function2(vector, 15, 0, SIZE-1));
25     return 0;
26 }
```

Regarding the implemented functions, evaluate the following statements:

I. The result of the print command on line 24 is: 7 - 7.

II. In the worst case, *function1* is a faster strategy than *function2*.

III. The function *function2* implements an iterative strategy in the design of the algorithm.

It is correct what is stated in

A) I, only.

B) III, only.

C) I and II, only.

D) II and III, only.

E) I, II and III.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let us analyze the code and the statements step by step:

The code provides two functions, `function1` and `function2`, which seem to be related to searching in an array.

### `function1`:
This function performs a linear search in the array to find the value `v`. If the value is found, it returns the index of the value in the array; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

### `function2`:
This function implements a binary search in the array. Binary search is a strategy that looks for a value in an array by repeatedly dividing the array in half until the value is found or the search range is empty.

Now, let's analyze the statements:

**I. The output of the print statement on line 24 is: 7 - 7.**

To check this, we need to see the return of `function1(array, 15)` and `function2(array, 15, 0, SIZE-1)`.

- `function1(array, 15)`: The function will iterate through the array linearly until it finds the value `15`. The value `15` is at the index `7` of the array. Therefore, `function1` will return `7`.

- `function2(array, 15, 0, SIZE-1)`: The function will start with the binary search, beginning in the middle of the array. The value in the middle (index 5) is `11`, which is less than `15`, so the function will search in the right half of the array. Then, the value in the middle of that half is `15`, which is the value we are looking for. Therefore, `function2` will also return `7`.

Statement I is correct.

**II. The function function1, in the worst case, is a faster strategy than function2.**

This is not true. `function1` is a linear search and, in the worst case, has a time complexity of O(n). `function2` is a binary search and, in the worst case, has a time complexity of O(log n). Therefore, in the worst case, `function2` (binary search) is faster than `function1` (linear search).

Statement II is incorrect.

**III. The function function2 implements an iterative strategy in the design of the algorithm.**

In fact, the function `function2` implements a recursive approach, not an iterative one. With each call of the function, it calls itself again with a new set of parameters, reducing the search space by half. This is a characteristic of recursion.

Statement III is incorrect.

Given the analysis, the correct alternative is: **A) I, only.**

**Answer key**: A
