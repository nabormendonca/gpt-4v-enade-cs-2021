## Question 15 ##

(Click [here](q15-por.md) to view the question's original image and ChaGPT-4 Vision's prompts and responses in Portuguese)

The emergence of agile methodologies eliminated management based on plans, replacing it with incremental planning. Project documentation has been minimized and no longer calls for a project manager. Unfortunately, this type of approach does not meet the needs of organizations, where business managers need to follow the progress of projects, control the budget, establish priorities and update their business plans. In this context, SCRUM was developed, a framework for the organization of agile projects. SCRUM foresees two individuals: the Scrum Master and the Product Owner, who are responsible for acting as the interface between the development team and the organization.

SOMMERVILLE, I. Engineering Software Products: An Introduction to Modern Software Engineering. Boston: Pearson, 2019 (adapted).

Regarding the SCRUM methodology, evaluate the following statements.

I. The role of the Scrum Master is to guide the team in the effective use of the SCRUM methodology.

II. The role of the Product Owner is to ensure the focus on the product, avoiding getting lost in less relevant technical issues.

III. Both the Scrum Master and the Product Owner have direct authority over the team.

It is correct what is stated in

A) II, only.

B) III, only.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**: 

Let's evaluate the statements relating to the text:

**I. The role of the Scrum Master is to guide the team in the effective use of SCRUM methodology.**
The function of the Scrum Master is indeed to lead and ensure that the team follows the principles and practices of SCRUM. Therefore, statement I is true.

**II. The role of the Product Owner is to ensure the focus on the product, preventing it from getting lost in less relevant technical issues.**
The Product Owner is responsible for the product vision and priorities. He must ensure that the team is working on the most valuable and relevant features. The statement does not detail all the responsibilities of the Product Owner, but the essence of what is mentioned here is correct. Thus, statement II is true.

**III. Both the Scrum Master and the Product Owner have direct authority over the team.**
This is a bit more complicated. The Scrum Master does not have authority over the team in the sense of hierarchical management; instead, he serves as a facilitator and guide. The Product Owner has authority in regard to what is worked on (for example, by setting priorities), but again, not in the traditional sense of a "boss". Therefore, statement III is misleading and can be considered false.

Now, let's look at the options:
**A)** II only.
**B)** III only.
**C)** I and II only.
**D)** I and III only.
**E)** I, II and III.

Considering the above evaluations, the correct alternative is **C) I and II only.**.

**Answer key**: C

**Verdict**

The ChatGPT's response is consistent with the answer key.
