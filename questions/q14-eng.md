## Question 14 ##

<img src="q14-image.png" alt="Question 14 image file" width="60%" height="60%">

**English transcription of the question:**

The first computer created was the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), developed by Eckert and Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania, United States. The project began in 1943, funded by the American government. The period was World War II and the goal was to calculate more agilely the best trajectories for transporting weapons and supplies amidst enemy armies. This is the type of calculation that small cellular devices do today to find routes in cities through GPS (Global Positioning System) and map analysis. The project was only completed in 1946, too late to be used for the Second World War, but it was widely used until 1955.

Many projects emerged after ENIAC, but they were hindered by some difficulties and limitations, such as the fact that they were not programmed and worked with decimal numbers. The problem with working with decimals is that each stored digit has 10 possible states, representing numbers from 0 to 9. Within an electronic system, this is complicated because the charge of each device, whether it be a transistor or a valve, should be measured to verify which number it was representing. Errors were very frequent. It was enough for a valve to be outside the ideal temperature for the results of operations to start going wrong. Von Neumann then recommended that, in his architecture, data and instructions should begin to be stored in binary code, facilitating their analysis and reducing the amount of errors.

Regarding the Von Neumann architecture, evaluate the assertions below and the proposed relationship between them.

I. Although computer architectures have evolved a lot from ENIAC to modern notebooks, the Von Neumann architecture, conceived in the 1950s, has remained up to this day.

BECAUSE

II. The Von Neumann architecture allows the CPU to perform a fetch of one or more instructions beyond the next one to be executed; this technique is used to accelerate the CPU's operating speed, since the next instruction to be executed is normally stored in the CPU's registers and not in the main memory, which is much slower.

Regarding these assertions, select the correct option.

A) Assertions I and II are true propositions, and II is a correct justification for I.

B) Assertions I and II are true propositions, but II is not a correct justification for I.

C) Assertion I is a true proposition, and II is a false proposition.

D) Assertion I is a false proposition, and II is a true proposition.

E) Assertions I and II are false propositions.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's analyze the text and the options provided step by step:

**Text:** The passage provides a description of the history of ENIAC and highlights Von Neumann's contribution to computer architecture, emphasizing that he recommended that, in its architecture, both data and instructions were to be stored in binary code.

Now, analyzing the assertions:

**I.** Although computer architectures have evolved greatly from ENIAC to today's modern laptops, the Von Neumann architecture, a concept from the 1950s, has remained until the present day.

**II.** The Von Neumann architecture allows the CPU to fetch one or more instructions beyond the next one to be executed; this technique is used to speed up the CPU's operating pace, since the next instruction to be executed is normally stored in the CPU's registers and does not need to be fetched from the main memory, which is much slower.

**Analysis:**

**I:** The first assertion aligns with the text, as it emphasizes the ongoing relevance of the Von Neumann architecture, even with technological evolutions since the ENIAC. Therefore, assertion I is true.

**II:** The second assertion discusses a characteristic of the Von Neumann architecture related to the CPU fetching several instructions beyond the next one to be executed. However, the original text does not specifically mention this characteristic of the Von Neumann architecture. Therefore, we do not have evidence in the text to confirm or refute assertion II.

Now, analyzing the alternatives in relation to the assertions:

**A)** Assertions I and II are true propositions, and II is a correct justification of I.
**B)** Assertions I and II are true propositions, but II is not a correct justification of I.
**C)** Assertion I is a true proposition, and II is a false proposition.
**D)** Assertion I is a false proposition, and II is a true proposition.
**E)** Assertions I and II are false propositions.

Conclusion:
Assertion I is definitely true based on the text. Assertion II lacks sufficient evidence in the text to be confirmed or refuted. However, even if we assume that assertion II is true, it does not serve as a justification for assertion I. Therefore, the most appropriate alternative is **B** "Assertions I and II are true propositions, but II is not a correct justification for I."

**Prompt**: Your answer differs from the answer key released for this question: [answer key]

After analyzing the answer key, do you maintain or change your response? If you decide to change your response, explain the possible reasons that led you to errors in the previous answer. Try to identify the concrete causes of the errors instead of listing generic reasons, such as a failure to understand the question statement.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Maintaining my previous analysis, the correct answer is alternative **B**.

Reasons for the error in the previous response (in case my initial analysis was wrong):

1. **Detail not mentioned in the text**: The second assertion discusses a specific detail about the Von Neumann architecture that was not mentioned in the original text. Therefore, the absence of this specific information could have led to an incorrect answer.
2. **Relationship between Assertions**: There may be a possible lack of clarity in the relationship between the two assertions. Even if both assertions were true, the second does not directly justify the first.
3. **Interpretation of "Because"**: The causal relationship between the two assertions was not clearly established in the statement. The use of the word "Because" suggests a justification, but assertion II does not serve as a direct justification for assertion I, based on the information provided in the text.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the text and the assertions provided, alternative **B** is the most appropriate answer.

## Experts assessment ##

**Expert #1**

The fundamental characteristic of the Von Neumann architecture is that the data and instructions used by a program are in the same memory. During the execution of the program, instructions and data are fetched from memory according to the logic defined by that program. Therefore, assertion I is true.

Assertion II should be considered as false (or we cannot consider it true based on what was presented...). The architecture as proposed by Von Neumann foresaw the fetching of only the next instruction each cycle. This instruction is then stored in an instruction register, which is decoded and executed by the CPU. Thus, the fetch of "more instructions beyond the next" should not be accepted here as an intrinsic feature of the Von Neumann architecture. Another incorrect statement is that fetching more instructions in memory is a technique that speeds up CPU performance. In fact, CPU performance increases depend on many other more important factors (which were part of the first versions of microprocessors) such as increased clock frequency, multiple data paths, new communication protocols memory-processor and, more recently, multiple cores.

Another point not entirely correct is that the additional instructions that are fetched are in the registers and therefore do not need to be fetched from memory anymore. This is only valid if there are no decision points and 100% of the speculatively fetched instructions are effectively executed, which is not the case for the vast majority of programs to be run.

Also, the so-called Von Neumann bottleneck, well-known when thinking of performance limits, designates only the processor-memory communication, and the fetching of more instructions addresses much more an issue of THROUGHPUT than CPU SPEED. Since the sentence II did not clearly speak about THROUGHPUT, it would be another reason not to consider it 100% true

Therefore, I would choose option C, that is, I - true and II - false.

**Expert #2**

This is the kind of question I do not like, as they use a detail to invalidate the question, namely the issue of the registers. It was a very subtle thing that chatGPT did not catch. In fact, with cache locality the next instructions are already brought into L1.

Therefore, unfortunately the official answer key is correct, but the question is tricky.

---

**Expert #3**

My response is that I agree with the answer key.

Assertion I is definitely true, not exactly because of the text itself, which is summarized, but much more because of my knowledge. Although the question does not ask to stick to the text.

Assertion II, in my opinion, is false because the next instruction to be executed is NOT stored in the CPU's registers. Depending on the processor, the performance of the next instructions could even be increased if they were in the instruction CACHE, but still, at some point, the instructions would need to be copied from RAM to the cache. Additionally, the fact of "accelerating the CPU speed" by fetching more instructions than the next one to be executed is independent of the architecture. That is, any architecture other than Von Neumann's can easily implement this strategy.

Therefore, I say and repeat that I agree with the answer key and the answer is C.

Regarding the ChatGPT response, I thought it was somewhat on the fence when it said that assertion II "does not have sufficient evidence in the text to be confirmed or refuted". First, there was nothing saying that the answer had to be based on the text. Second, I think that ChatGPT, at least until now, is unaware of this very specific detail of the registers of computer architectures.

**Verdict**

According to the experts, the answer key is correct and the response from ChatGPT is incorrect.

## ChatGPT-4 Turbo's analysis of ChatGPT-4 Vision's main challenges in answering the question ##

**Prompt**: The following are the prompts and responses of a generative AI for the attached question, along with possible assessments by two or more human experts on the generative AI's responses and the general quality of the question. Based on the provided information, summarize the main difficulties faced by the generative AI in attempting to answer the question, including possible difficulties resulting from incorrect recognition of some graphical or textual element present in the statement of the question. Consider only concrete difficulties whose manifestation can be evidenced by the information provided in generative AI's responses. At the end, discuss if these difficulties could be mitigated or eliminated by using prompt engineering techniques or if they would be inherent to the limitations of current large language models (LLMs).

---

**ChatGPT-4 Turbo response**:

The generative AI was asked to respond to a question about the Von Neumann architecture and the evolution of computer architectures from the ENIAC to modern notebooks. The AI's response was that while assertion I was true, assertion II could not be confirmed or refuted based on the text, leading it to choose option B as the correct answer. However, the official answer key indicated that the correct answer was C.

The main difficulties faced by the generative AI in answering the question seemed to stem from:

1. An incorrect interpretation of assertion II regarding the CPU fetching instructions beyond the next one to be executed. The AI did not find evidence in the text to confirm or refute this, but specialists pointed out that this was a specific detail not mentioned in the original text and that the AI was unaware of the intricacies of Von Neumann's architecture related to instruction fetching.

2. The AI might have been misled by the word "Because" which suggested a causal justification between assertions I and II, but as the specialists noted, the AI failed to recognize that the speed of the CPU is not solely dependent on the instruction fetch strategy.

As for whether these difficulties could be mitigated or eliminated through prompt engineering techniques or are inherent to current limitations of large language models (LLMs), there are a few points to consider:

- The AI's failure to provide a definitive stance on assertion II suggests a lack of specific knowledge about the Von Neumann architecture's details, which may not be fully mitigated by prompt engineering alone.

- The AI's reliance on text evidence for validation of the assertions shows a potential limitation in its ability to apply external knowledge or infer beyond the provided text. While prompt engineering could potentially encourage the AI to draw more on external knowledge, it would not compensate for the AI's fundamental gaps in understanding complex technical content.

- The misinterpretation of the causal relationship implied by "Because" points to a possible linguistic or reasoning limitation, which could be improved with better-designed prompts that guide the AI's reasoning process more effectively.

In conclusion, some of the AI's difficulties could potentially be addressed through more sophisticated prompt engineering, but others are indicative of the intrinsic limitations of LLMs in their current state, particularly regarding deep, technical understanding and the integration of complex information that's not explicitly stated in the text.
