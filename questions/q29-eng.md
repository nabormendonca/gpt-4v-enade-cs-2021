**English transcription of the question:**

Morphological operations are a set of operations that process images based on shapes. Morphological operations apply a structuring element B to an input image A and generate an output image.

In relation to the morphological operations of Erosion and Dilation, evaluate the following statements.

I. Dilation: As the kernel B is applied over the image, we calculate the maximum pixel value overlapping with B and we replace the image pixel, at the anchor point position, with this maximum value; example: \[Graphic depiction of the process of Dilation, showing how the kernel overlaps with pixels and the resulting dilation effect.\]

II. Dilation: As the kernel B is applied over the image, we calculate the minimum pixel value overlapping with B and we replace the image pixel, at the anchor point position, with this maximum value; example: \[Graphic depiction of the process of Dilation, showing how the kernel overlaps with pixels and the error in this example of replacing with a maximum value when it should be minimum.\]

III. Erosion: As the kernel B is applied over the image, we calculate the maximum pixel value overlapping with B and we replace the image pixel, at the anchor point position, with this maximum value; example: \[Graphic depiction of the process of Erosion, showing correct application and the resulting effect of erosion.\]

IV. Erosion: As the kernel B is applied over the image, we calculate the minimum pixel value overlapping with B and we replace the image pixel, at the anchor point position, with this maximum value; example: \[Graphic depiction of the process of Erosion, illustrating an error by suggesting replacement with a maximum value instead of the minimum.\]
