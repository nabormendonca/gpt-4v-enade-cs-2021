A distributed system is one in which hardware or software components, located on networked computers, communicate and coordinate their actions only by sending messages to each other.

COULOURIS, G. et al. Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design. 5th ed., Porto Alegre: Bookman, 2013 (adapted).

Based on the definition presented and the basic concepts of distributed systems, select the correct option.

A) The existence of a local physical clock synchronized with a global clock is what allows users of a distributed system to exchange messages in a coordinated way.

B) The failure of a component in a peer-to-peer distributed system causes the interruption of all other components until its recovery.

C) The sharing of distributed resources among computers connected by a network is possible as long as the devices are homogeneous in terms of hardware and software.

D) The addition of new devices to a distributed system to meet a temporary or growing demand is linked to the scalability characteristic of the system.

E) The possibility of several clients concurrently accessing the same shared resource on a server is the result of the system's high level of transparency.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's analyze each alternative based on the definition and basic concepts of distributed systems:

**A)** *The existence of a local physical clock synchronized with a global clock is what allows users of a distributed system to exchange messages in a coordinated manner.*
- This is not exactly true. Message exchanging in distributed systems does not necessarily depend on a local physical clock synchronized with a global clock. Clock synchronization is useful for ordering events, but communication can occur even without it.

**B)** *The failure of one component in a peer-to-peer distributed system causes the interruption of all other components until its return.*
- This is not true. One of the advantages of distributed systems, especially peer-to-peer types, is fault tolerance. If one node fails, the other nodes can continue operating normally.

**C)** *The sharing of distributed resources among computers interconnected by a network is possible as long as the devices are homogeneous in terms of hardware and software.*
- This is false. Distributed systems can involve heterogeneous computers. In fact, many distributed systems are designed to work with devices of different types and capabilities.

**D)** *The addition of new devices to a distributed system to meet a temporary or increasing demand is linked to the scalability characteristic of the system.*
- This is true. Scalability is one of the main advantages of distributed systems. They can be scaled to accommodate more resources and meet increasing demand by simply adding more nodes to the system.

**E)** *The possibility of several clients accessing the same shared resource on a server concurrently is a result of the high level of transparency of the system.*
- This is partially true. Transparency in distributed systems refers to the fact that the details of where and how resources are located are hidden from the users. However, concurrency is managed by concurrency control protocols and not necessarily by transparency.

Given the reasoning above, the only option that is completely correct is **D) The addition of new devices to a distributed system to meet a temporary or increasing demand is linked to the scalability characteristic of the system.**
