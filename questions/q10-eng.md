**English transcription of the question:**

The Java language collections library provides implementations intended for elementary data structures, such as lists, queues, and stacks. Consider the following definitions of classes that represent implementations of data structures available in the language library:

- Class A: objects are organized in a linear order and can only be inserted at the beginning or end of this sequence;

- Class B: objects are organized in a linear order determined by a reference to the next object;

- Class C: objects are removed in the opposite order in which they were inserted;

- Class D: objects are inserted and removed following the rule: the element to be removed is always the one that was inserted first.

In this context, select the alternative that represents, respectively, the data structures implemented by classes A, B, C, and D.

A) Circular list, simply linked list, stack, and queue.

B) Deque, simply linked list, stack, and queue.

C) Doubly linked list, simply linked list, queue, and stack.

D) Stack, queue, deque, and simply chained list.

E) Deque, stack, linked list, and queue.**Prompt**: Answer the question(s) in this image by explaining step by step the reasoning used to answer it(them). In the end, choose which of the five provided alternatives (A-E) is the correct one. Report if more than one alternative is correct or if all five alternatives are incorrect.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**: 

Letâ€™s analyze each class and identify what kind of data structure it represents:

1. **Class A**: Objects are arranged in a linear order and can be inserted only at the beginning or the end of this sequence.
   - This describes a **deque** (Double Ended Queue). In a deque, it is possible to insert and remove elements from both ends.

2. **Class B**: Objects are arranged in a linear order determined by a reference to the next object.
   - This is the characteristic of a **singly linked list**, where each element points to the next one in the list.

3. **Class C**: Objects are removed in the opposite order to which they were inserted.
   - This is the basic definition of a **stack**. In a stack, the last object inserted is the first to be removed (LIFO - Last In First Out).

4. **Class D**: Objects are inserted and removed respecting the following rule: the element to be removed is always the one that was inserted first.
   - This describes a **queue**. In a queue, the first object inserted is the first to be removed (FIFO - First In First Out).

Given these analyses, the alternative that correctly corresponds to the description of classes A, B, C, and D is:

Answer: B) Deque, singly linked list, stack, and queue.
