**English transcription of the question:**

A compiler is software that translates a program described in a high-level language into an equivalent program in machine code for a processor. Generally, a compiler does not directly produce the machine code, but rather, a program in symbolic language (assembly) semantically equivalent to the program in high-level language. The program in symbolic language is then translated into the machine program through assemblers. To carry out this task, the compiler executes lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis of the source code of the program that is being executed in abstract language to later generate machine code.

Considering the information in the text, evaluate the following statements.

I. The syntactic analyzer has the function to verify if the sequence of symbols generated by the lexical analyzer composes a valid program or not.

II. In lexical analysis, the analyzer will identify each symbol that has meaning for the language, generating the same classification for Java, Pascal, or another language.

III. The semantic analyzer uses the source code to verify inconsistencies regarding the meaning of the implemented constructs.

IV. The code optimization phase seeks to improve the intermediate code, aiming for a machine code that runs faster in terms of execution.

It is correct only what is stated in

A) I and IV.

B) II and III.

C) II and IV.

D) I, II, and III.

E) I, III, and IV.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let’s analyze the statements:

I. The syntactic analyzer’s function is to verify whether the sequence of symbols generated by the lexical analyzer composes a valid program or not.
**Correct**. The syntactic analysis, or parsing, checks if the sequence of tokens (symbols) produced by lexical analysis follows the grammatical rules of the programming language.

II. In lexical analysis, the analyzer will identify each symbol that has meaning for the language, generating the same classification for Java, Pascal, or another language.
**Incorrect**. Lexical analysis identifies symbols and transforms them into tokens, but the classification of these tokens is not necessarily the same among different languages such as Java and Pascal.

III. The semantic analyzer uses the source code to verify inconsistencies regarding the meaning of the implemented constructions.
**Correct**. Semantic analysis is responsible for ensuring that the syntactically correct constructions also make sense in terms of their operation and meaning within the language.

IV. The code optimization phase aims to improve the intermediate code, aiming for faster machine code in terms of execution.
**Correct**. Optimization is a subsequent phase in the compiler stages that seeks to enhance code performance, making it more efficient without changing its semantics.

Given the analysis, the correct statements are I, III, and IV.

The correct answer is **E) I, III, and IV**.
