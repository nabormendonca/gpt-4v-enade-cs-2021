## Question 25 ##

(Click [here](q25-image.png) to view the question in its original image format in Portuguese)

Cloud computing can be defined as the communication infrastructure represented by several web servers, responsible for storing data and applications, where each part of this infrastructure is provided as a service and these are usually allocated in data centers, making use of shared hardware for computation and storage. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a cloud computing model must present 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, and 4 deployment models. The essential characteristics are: self-service on demand, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. Service models are Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and the deployment models are: Private Cloud, Community Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud.

Considering the presented information, evaluate the statements below.

I. In the SaaS model, the user does not need to acquire or perform a hardware upgrade to run applications, does not manage or control the underlying infrastructure, and the software updates are the cloud service provider's responsibility.

II. Elasticity is the capacity to automatically increase or decrease the time of availability of computational resources that were provisioned contractually for each user.

III. The Community Cloud has the objective of managing the computational resources belonging to each of the organizations participating in a community of organizations to share the software and hardware infrastructure among them.

IV. In the IaaS model, the user does not manage or control the cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications.

It is correct only what is stated in

A) I and II.

B) I and IV.

C) II and III.

D) I, III, and IV.

E) II, III, and IV.**Prompt**: Please answer the question(s) in this image by explaining step by step the reasoning used to respond to it. In the end, choose which one of the five alternatives provided (A-E) is correct. Inform if more than one alternative is correct or if all five alternatives are incorrect.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's evaluate the statements based on the information provided:

I. In the SaaS model, the user does not need to purchase or upgrade hardware to run applications, does not manage or control the underlying infrastructure, and software updates are the responsibility of the cloud service provider.

- **Correct**. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model where the user uses the software directly over the internet, without worrying about infrastructure, hardware, or updates. The provider takes care of all of this.

II. Elasticity is the ability to automatically increase or decrease the time resources are available that have been contractually provisioned for each user.

- **Incorrect**. Elasticity does indeed refer to the capacity to scale resources according to demand, but not specifically "the time of availability". It's more about the capacity of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

III. Community Cloud aims to manage the computing resources that belong to each of the participating organizations in a community of organizations to share the software and hardware infrastructure among all.

- **Correct**. Community Cloud is a deployment model that serves various organizations with similar objectives, sharing infrastructure among them.

IV. In the IaaS model, the user does not manage or control the cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications.

- **Correct**. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides the user with access and control over infrastructure resources like VMs, storage, and networks, but the management of the underlying physical infrastructure (such as data centers and hardware) is the responsibility of the provider.

Based on the above evaluations, statements I, III, and IV are correct, while statement II is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct alternative is **E, II, III, and IV**.

**Prompt**: Your answer differs from the answer key released for this question: [answer key]

After analyzing the answer key, do you maintain or change your answer? If you decide to change your answer, explain the possible reasons that led to the mistake. Try to identify the concrete causes of your error, instead of listing generic reasons such as a misunderstanding of the question's statement.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

I maintain my original answers.

Reasons for the errors in previous answers:

1. **Regarding statement II**: It seems there was a misinterpretation of the word "time" in the phrase "time of availability of computing resources". Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the capability of a system to adjust the amount of computing resources based on demand. It is not specific to "time of availability". My analysis was correct in considering this statement incorrect.

Concluding, based on the analysis, statements I, III, and IV are indeed correct and the statement II is incorrect. Therefore, the correct alternative should be **E, II, III, and IV** and not B, as indicated in the answer key.

**Prompt**: It seems that there is some confusion here. If statement II is incorrect, why would the correct alternative be E, which includes precisely statement II as correct? Doesn't make sense, does it?

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

I apologize for the oversight. You are absolutely right. If statement II is incorrect, then it should not be included among the correct responses.

Given that statements I, III, and IV are correct, the correct response must be alternative **D, I, III, and IV**.

I apologize again for the confusion and thank you for correcting me.

**Prompt**: What about the fact that the answer key considers statement III incorrect (alternative B)? Anything to disagree or add?

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's revisit statement III:

III. Community Cloud aims to manage the computing resources belonging to each of the organizations participating in a community of organizations to share software and hardware infrastructure among all.

Basing ourselves on the description of the Community Cloud, according to the text, it is a deployment model used to serve various organizations with similar objectives and to share the infrastructure among them. The statement seems to be in line with this description, as the Community Cloud indeed manages the resources of various organizations to share common infrastructure.

However, if the answer key considers statement III as incorrect, we can try to identify nuances that may have been interpreted differently:

1. **Resource management**: The statement mentions that Community Cloud "manages" the resources. It might be that the emphasis is on the word "manage". Community Cloud provides an environment for sharing, but not necessarily "manages" the resources of each participant organization. This could be construed as if the Community Cloud had active control over all resources of each organization, which might not be the case.

2. **Belonging to each of the organizations**: The structuring of this part of the statement could suggest that each organization has a defined and segregated ownership of the resources in the cloud, which might conflict with the idea of sharing.

That said, although statement III seems at first glance to align with the general description of Community Cloud, the specificity of language and interpretation of certain terms may render it inaccurate, depending on the exact definition that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides for Community Cloud.

**Prompt**: Just to clarify: do you maintain the interpretation that statement III would be correct (thus, alternative D would be correct), despite the nuances pointed out?

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Yes, based on the description provided in the text and the common interpretation of "Community Cloud", I maintain the interpretation that statement III is correct. Therefore, the alternative D (I, III, and IV) would be the correct answer, according to that interpretation. However, I recognize that multiple-choice questions can have nuances and specificities that might lead to different interpretations, and it is always important to review context and source when evaluating such questions.

**Expert Assessment**

**Expert #1**

I reviewed the question before seeing the Official Answer Key and ChatGPT's responses. Let's analyze the items:

**Item I**: There's no doubt that the statement is correct, and this coincides with the official and ChatGPT responses.

**Item II**: Elasticity is the ability of cloud providers to automatically increase/decrease the amount of resources according to what is demanded by applications. This characteristic is orthogonal to time. In a scenario where the costumer that uses the elastic resource has money, the increase can be "forever".

**Item III**: 

**What is correct in this item**: (1) Community clouds allow the sharing of hardware/software resources among organizations. For this, it is necessary to respect the sharing policies defined by the organizations. (2) At the same time, this sharing can only be carried out if there is management of the resources.

**What is not completely correct**: The purpose of community clouds is to manage the computational resources belonging to each of the organizations. A clearer wording would be: Community Cloud allows the sharing of computational resources among organizations and, for this, it manages the resources using sharing policies previously established by the organizations.

**Item IV**: There's no doubt that the statement is correct, and this coincides with the official and ChatGPT responses.

There is a lack of clarity in the wording of Item III and, because of this, **the question should have been annulled (the statement is ambiguous or incomplete)**.

**Expert #2**

The first part of the statement makes incorrect assertions (e.g., cloud computing is a communication infrastructure represented by several web servers). However, the question's command does not refer to this piece, which could have been discarded without loss (actually with benefits for understanding). So, I don't believe this inaccuracy is sufficient to annul the question. I understand that what is intended to be assessed is whether the candidate knows the cloud computing model defined by NIST. I agree with ChatGPT and the ENADE answer key that assertions I and IV are correct and II is incorrect. The question then is whether alternative III is correct, as ChatGPT claims, or not, as indicated in the official answer key.

Let's see what NIST says about "Community Cloud".

"Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises."

My understanding is that the deployment models define who the users who can use the cloud are. Only internal users in the private cloud, any user in the public cloud, and only users of the participating organizations in the community, in the community cloud. In hybrid clouds, the definition of allowed users will depend on the arrangement. The way resources are managed in each deployment model is not precisely defined in the NIST model ("It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises."). Although the purpose of a community cloud is what is written in alternative III, the deployment model is about another issue, not emphasized in the assertion. Therefore, I understand that assertion III is incorrect.

Conclusion: the answer key is correct (although the question was poorly formulated).

**Expert #3**

My response is: **the question should have been annulled (for example, because there is more than one correct answer, no answer is correct, or the statement is ambiguous or incomplete)**.

This type of question is terrible and should never have been included in ENADE. For me, it evaluates nothing and is full of tricks.

In my assessment, strictly speaking, the answer key is correct, but it is totally unfair to the students taking the test.

It starts with the first sentence of the statement being wrong:
"... communication infrastructure represented by several *web* servers ..."

Web servers? Of course not! It sounds like a layperson speaking!

About assertion III, I thought it was correct, but I had to go to the NIST document to understand a possible reason for it being considered wrong!

So, the ENADE question says that all organizations in the community have resources, but the NIST definition says that not all need to have resources.

This is not a serious question! And ChatGPT couldn't catch this subtlety!

On the other hand, reading quickly on the cell phone, it seemed to me that assertion II could also be correct. This is because "availability time" can have various interpretations. Taking a test, I would be suspicious!

That's it!

I'm sad that such a poorly formulated question was used to evaluate computer science students.

**Verdict**

ChatGPT's response is inconsistent with the answer key, and the experts did not reach a consensus on what the correct answer would be nor whether the question should be annulled.

**Analysis of prompts, responses, and expert comments by ChatGPT-4 Turbo**

**Prompt**: The attached files contain an image of a question, the prompts and responses of a generative AI used to answer that question, and comments from two or more human experts on the AI's generative responses and the overall quality of the question in general. Based on the information present in these files, summarize the main difficulties faced by the generative AI in attempting to answer the question, including any difficulties arising from incorrect recognition of any graphical or textual element present in the question's statement. Consider only concrete difficulties whose manifestation can be evidenced by the information present in the files. In the end, discuss whether these difficulties could be mitigated or eliminated using prompt engineering techniques, or if they would be inherent to the limitations of current large language models (LLMs).

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

The AI generative tool faced difficulties in answering the cloud computing question, mainly regarding the interpretation and correct application of the information in the text to the presented assertions. The difficulties encountered include:

1. **Interpreting Assertions**: The AI initially interpreted that assertions I, III, and IV were correct and that assertion II was incorrect. However, after being confronted with the official answer key, which considered assertion III as incorrect, the AI maintained its original interpretation of assertions I and IV but expressed uncertainty regarding assertion III.

2. **Confusion with the Answer Key**: The AI initially selected the wrong alternative (E), including assertion II as correct, and then corrected itself to alternative D (I, III, and IV) upon realizing the error. However, the official answer key marked alternative B (II and III), contradicting the AI's response and leading to further review.

3. **Feedback from Experts**: The experts provided different perspectives, with one pointing out ambiguity in the question and suggesting cancellation, while others maintained different interpretations of assertion III based on NIST definitions, and a third criticized the formulation of the question in general.

These difficulties demonstrate a challenge for the AI in dealing with ambiguities and nuances of text, as well as highlighting the importance of clarity in the formulation of exam questions. Prompt engineering could help the AI in requesting clarifications or considering different interpretations based on external sources like NIST definitions, but it would not fully resolve the issue of discrepancies between various expert interpretations or textual ambiguities.

Therefore, the difficulties faced by the AI reflect limitations of current LLMs, which may have challenges with:

- Interpreting ambiguous or technically complex language correctly.

- Adjusting their responses based on contradictory feedback or official answer keys.

- Navigating effectively through poorly formulated questions that require specific and updated knowledge.

These issues highlight the need for continuous advancements in AI models to improve contextual understanding and the ability to deal with ambiguities and varied feedback.
