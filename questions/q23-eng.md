## Question 23 ##

(Click [here](q23-image.png) to view the question in its original image format in Portuguese)

The use of the data structure known as the Binary Search Tree is a fundamental programming technique. A binary tree is a finite set of elements that is either empty or partitioned into three subsets, namely: 1) the root of the tree - the initial element (unique), 2) the left subtree - if viewed in isolation, it forms another tree, and 3) the right subtree - if viewed in isolation, it also forms another tree. The tree may not have any elements (empty tree). The definition of a tree is recursive, and because of this, many operations on binary trees use recursion. Being "A" the root of a binary tree and "B" the root of its left or right subtree, it is said that "A" is the parent of "B" and "B" is the child of "A". An element without children is called a leaf. The height of the tree is the number of elements found on the longest descending path that connects its root to a leaf.

A Binary Search Tree is a specialized binary tree, in which the information that the left child holds is numerically less than the information of the parent element. Similarly, the information that the right child element holds is numerically greater than or equal to the information of the parent element. The purpose of organizing data in Binary Search Trees is to facilitate the task of finding a particular element. The complete traversal of a binary tree involves visiting all the elements of the tree, according to some criteria, in order to process them. Three well-known methods for performing this traversal are: 1) pre-order, 2) in-order, and 3) post-order. The following figure shows an example of a binary tree.

\[Figure - Example of a Binary Tree. The figure shows a diagram of a binary tree with the letter "J" at the root, "D" and "O" as the children of "J", "A" as the child of "D", "L" and "R" as the children of "O", and "K" and "M" as the children of "L".\]

Considering the text and figure presented and that the following list of numerical elements: (27, 34, 40, 18, 23, 5, 25, 36, 10, 7, -2) is fully transferred to a Binary Search Tree structure, initially empty, element by element, from left to right, select the correct alternative.

A) The resulting tree will have 5 levels of height, with 6 elements to the left of the main (initial) root and 4 elements to the right.

B) The tree traversal in Pre-order will process the elements in the following order (from first to last): -2, 7, 10, 5, 25, 23, 18, 36, 40, 34, 27.

C) The tree traversal in In-order will process the elements in the following order (from first to last): -2, 5, 7, 10, 18, 23, 25, 27, 34, 36, 40.

D) The tree traversal in Post-order will process the elements in the following order (from first to last): 27, 18, 5, -2, 10, 7, 23, 25, 34, 40, 36.

E) The maximum number of elements that this tree can have with 10 levels will be 1,024 elements.**Prompt**: Answer the question(s) in this image by explaining step-by-step the reasoning used to answer it (them).

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's solve the question step by step:

### Binary Search Tree:
As described, in a binary search tree, the left child of a node has a numerically lesser value than the node, and the right child has a numerically greater or equal value to the node.

Given the list of elements: 27, 34, 40, 18, 23, 5, 25, 36, 10, 7, -2

Insertion into the tree will happen in the order of the list:

1. **27** - Will be the root of the tree.
2. **34** - Greater than 27, therefore, goes to the right of 27.
3. **40** - Greater than 27 and 34, therefore, goes to the right of 34.
4. **18** - Less than 27, therefore, goes to the left of 27.
5. **23** - Greater than 18 but lesser than 27, therefore, goes to the right of 18.
6. **5** - Less than 27 and 18, therefore, goes to the left of 18.
7. **25** - Greater than 18 and 5 but lesser than 23 and 27, therefore, goes to the left of 23.
8. **36** - Greater than 27 and 34 but lesser than 40, therefore, goes to the left of 40.
9. **10** - Less than 27 and 18 but greater than 5, therefore, goes to the right of 5.
10. **7** - Less than 27, 18, and 10 but greater than 5, therefore, goes to the left of 10.
11. **-2** - Less than all, therefore, goes to the left of 5.

### Analysis of the options:

**A.** The resulting tree has **4 levels of height** (including the root), with 4 elements to the left of the main (initial) root and 3 to the right.

**B.** Pre-order traversal:
- We process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Order: 27, 18, 5, -2, 10, 7, 23, 25, 34, 40, 36.

**C.** In-order traversal:
- We process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Order: -2, 5, 7, 10, 18, 23, 25, 27, 34, 36, 40.

**D.** Post-order traversal:
- We process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
- Order: -2, 7, 10, 5, 25, 23, 18, 36, 40, 34, 27.

**E.** The maximum number of elements that a binary tree can have with 10 levels is \(2^{10} - 1\), which is 1023.

Therefore, the correct option is **C**.
