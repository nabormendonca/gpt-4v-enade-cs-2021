## Question 27 ##

(Click [here](q27-image.png) to view the question in its original image format in Portuguese)

The following figure shows the histogram of a sample composed of 20,000 servers. The x-axis shows the number of simultaneous requests on these servers. For example, the value 168 indicates that there are 1,850 servers with the capacity to handle 168 simultaneous requests.

\[In the image, there is a histogram with the x-axis labeled "Capacity" ranging from values 122 to 234 in increments, and the y-axis labeled "Frequency" ranging from 0 to 2000 in increments. Vertical bars represent the frequency of each capacity value within the sample of servers. At the top right corner, there is a small table with two rows and two columns. The header of the first row is "Mean" with a value of 171 besides it, and the header of the second row is "Standard Deviation" with a value of 10 besides it.\]

Is it possible to assert that when connecting to a server from this sample at random, there is approximately:

A) 34.13% chance that its capacity is in the interval \[141, 201\].

B) 34.13% chance that its capacity is in the interval \[161, 181\].

C) 76.68% chance that its capacity is in the interval \[171, 191\].

D) 95.44% chance that its capacity is in the interval \[151, 191\].

E) 99.74% chance that its capacity is in the interval \[161, 181\].**Prompt**: Answer the question(s) in this image by explaining step by step the reasoning used to answer it(them). At the end, choose which of the five provided alternatives (A-E) is correct. Inform if there is more than one correct alternative or if all five alternatives are incorrect.

**ChatGPT-4 Vision response**:

Let's start by examining the information provided and then evaluate each capacity range based on the empirical rule for normal distributions:

Given:

- Mean (μ) = 171
- Standard Deviation (σ) = 10

**Empirical rule for normal distributions (bell curve):**
- Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
- Approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

Let's apply this rule:

1. **1 Standard Deviation**:
   - Range: [171 - 10, 171 + 10]
   - Range: [161, 181]
   - Chance: 68%

2. **2 Standard Deviations**:
   - Range: [171 - 2(10), 171 + 2(10)]
   - Range: [151, 191]
   - Chance: 95%

3. **3 Standard Deviations**:
   - Range: [171 - 3(10), 171 + 3(10)]
   - Range: [141, 201]
   - Chance: 99.7%

With this information, we can now evaluate the options:

A) **[141, 201]**: This interval is 3 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the chance is approximately 99.7%.

B) **[161, 181]**: This interval is 1 standard deviation from the mean. Therefore, the chance is approximately 68%.

C) **[171, 191]**: This interval starts at the mean and extends 1 standard deviation to the right. Half of the 68% (1 standard deviation) is 34%. Adding to that, 50% (the half of the distribution to the left of the mean) gives us 84%. But this option is clearly less than 95% (2 standard deviations), so it's not exactly 84%, but it is more than 68%.

D) **[151, 191]**: This interval is 2 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the chance is approximately 95%.

E) **[161, 181]**: Already discussed above, the chance is approximately 68%.

Given the options, and using the empirical rule:

Option **A** is closest to 99.7%.
Option **B** is exactly 68%.
Option **D** is exactly 95%.

Therefore, the correct alternative is **D, a 95.44% chance that your capacity is within the range [151, 191]**.
