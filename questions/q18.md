**QUESTION 18**

Machine learning techniques employ an inference principle called induction, in which it is possible to obtain generic conclusions from a particular set of examples. These intuitive learning techniques can be divided into two main types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised learning, a reference for the objective to achieve is provided, that is, a training with the knowledge of the environment. Differently, in unsupervised learning, no references are used, that is, there is no training with the knowledge of the environment.
