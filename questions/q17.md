**QUESTION 17**

During part of the time, a process is busy performing internal computations and other things that do not lead to race conditions. However, at times, a process may need to access a shared memory or files, or perform other critical tasks that can lead to races. This part of the program that uses the shared memory is called the critical section or critical region. If we could arrange things so that two processes never were in their critical regions at the same time, we could avoid races. Although this requirement avoids the conditions for a race, it is not sufficient to ensure that processes in parallel cooperate in the correct and efficient use of shared data. We need four conditions to be maintained to reach a good solution.

1. Two processes can never be simultaneously inside their critical regions.
   
2. No assumptions can be made about the speeds or the number of CPUs.

3. No process executing outside of its critical region should block any process.

4. No process must be forced to wait eternally to enter its critical region.

In an abstract sense, the behavior that we want is shown in the following figure.

\[The image shows a diagram labeled "Exclusão mútua usando regiões críticas" ("Mutual exclusion using critical regions") with two timelines for Process A and Process B. Points on the timeline indicate when each process enters and leaves the critical region, with associated actions. For Process B, there's a point indicating it is blocked, attempting to enter the critical region while Process A is inside. The horizontal axis is labeled 'Tempo' ('Time').\]

Considering the text and the figure presented, evaluate the assertions below and the proposed relationship between them.

I. In some situations, mutual exclusion can be achieved through disabling interrupts controlled by the Operating System, not allowing user control over its management.

BECAUSE

II. Interrupt disabling is a technique that can prevent the processor that is executing a process in its critical region from being interrupted to execute other code, being more efficient in multiprocessor systems due to the number of concurrent processes.

Regarding these assertions, select the correct option.

A) Assertions I and II are true propositions, and II is a correct justification for I.

B) Assertions I and II are true propositions, but II is not a correct justification for I.

C) Assertion I is a true proposition, and II is a false proposition.

D) Assertion I is a false proposition, and II is a true proposition.

E) Assertions I and II are false propositions.
