A body of knowledge represented in propositional logic uses logical connectives of implication (→) which represents the conditional, conjunction (∧) which represents the logical AND, the disjunction (∨) which represents the logical OR and the negation (¬) which represents the logical operator NOT. Let **P** be the following set of formulas of propositional logic:

1. a → ¬b
2. b ∧ a
3. ¬b ∨ b

let **Q** be the following set of formulas of propositional logic:

4. a ∨ b
5. b → ¬a

and let **R** be the formula

6. ¬b → a

See the truth table for these formulas.

\[Table displaying truth values for propositions a and b, and corresponding truth values for formulas 1 through 6. The table has columns labeled "a", "b", "a → ¬b", "b ∧ a", "¬b ∨ b", "a ∨ b", "b → ¬a", "¬b → a", with rows that provide the truth values (True or False) for each formula based on the combination of truth values for a and b.\]

It is known that each row in the truth table corresponds to an attribution of truth values for the propositional symbols (a and b) and each column corresponds to the evaluation of the formula for that attribution. Some definitions:

(i) A formula is a *tautology* if and only if, for every attribution of truth-values, its evaluation is true.

(ii) An attribution of truth-values *satisfies* a set of formulas if and only if, for every formula in the set, the evaluation is true.

(iii) A set of formulas is *satisfiable* if and only if there exists an attribution of truth-values that satisfies the set. Otherwise, it is *unsatisfiable*.

(iv) A formula is a *logical consequence* of a set of formulas if and only if, for every truth-value attribution that satisfies the set, the attribution also *satisfies* the formula.

Based on the information presented, answer the following items:

a) Is there any tautology in formulas 1 to 6? Justify your answer. (value: 2.5 points)

b) Is there any satisfiable set (**P** or **Q**)? Justify your answer. (value: 2.5 points)

c) Is there any unsatisfiable set (**P** or **Q**)? Justify your answer. (value: 2.5 points)

d) Is formula 6 a logical consequence of **Q**? Justify your answer. (value: 2.5 points)
